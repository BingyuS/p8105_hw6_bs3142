### Data Import & Cleaning

-   **Create a city\_state variable (e.g. “Baltimore, MD”), and a binary variable indicating whether the homicide is solved. Omit cities Dallas, TX; Phoenix, AZ; and Kansas City, MO – these don’t report victim race. Also omit Tulsa, AL – this is a data entry mistake. Modifiy victim\_race to have categories white and non-white, with white as the reference category. Be sure that victim\_age is numeric.**

``` r
homicides_data =
  read_csv("./data/homicide-data.csv", na = c("", "NA", "Unknown")) %>%
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = ", "),
    resolution = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest"      ~ "solved"
      )
  ) %>%
  filter(
    !(city_state %in% c("Dallas, TX", "Phoenix, AZ", "Kansas City, MO", "Tulsa, AL"))) %>%
  na.omit() %>%
  mutate(
    binary_resolution = as.numeric(disposition == "Closed by arrest"),
    victim_age = as.numeric(victim_age),
    victim_race = ifelse(victim_race == "White", "white", "non-white"),
    victim_race = fct_relevel(victim_race, "white")
  )
## Parsed with column specification:
## cols(
##   uid = col_character(),
##   reported_date = col_integer(),
##   victim_last = col_character(),
##   victim_first = col_character(),
##   victim_race = col_character(),
##   victim_age = col_integer(),
##   victim_sex = col_character(),
##   city = col_character(),
##   state = col_character(),
##   lat = col_double(),
##   lon = col_double(),
##   disposition = col_character()
## )
```
